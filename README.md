## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

Follow these steps to set up the scraper.

**1. Clone or Download**

First, get the project files onto your local machine.

**2. Create a Virtual Environment**

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to keep dependencies clean.

```bash
python -m venv venv
```
Activate it:
* On Windows:
    ```bash
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
* On macOS/Linux:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

**3. Install Dependencies**

Install all the required Python libraries from the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Install Browser Files**

Playwright needs to download the browser instances it will control. This is a one-time setup.

```bash
playwright install
```

## üöÄ How to Use

Simply run the script from your terminal:

```bash
python wallpaper_scraper.py
```

The script will launch and prompt you to enter a URL from `WallpaperCave.com`.

* **To scrape a whole category**, provide a category URL (e.g., `https://wallpapercave.com/categories/games`).
* **To scrape a single album**, provide an album URL (e.g., `https://wallpapercave.com/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-wallpapers`).
* **For the default option**, just press `Enter`, and it will use the pre-configured URL.
